## Intro
I'm a 3rd year majoring in **Cognitive Science (Machine Learning & Neural Compuation track)**, and working towards a **Computer Science** minor. I work as an RA in Revelle College, and a UX design & web assistant for UC San Diego Library's web team.   

My favorite colors are `#FF750` and `#031273`.

## Experience with SWE
I've done work in **web accessibility**, user-centric **design**, and **frontend development**! Like a ton of new developers today, I started out using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but transitioned into TypeScript and frameworks (mostly [React](https://react.dev/), which [I now know has problems](https://www.zachleat.com/web/react-criticism/)) fairly early on. 
I really enjoy considering the accessibility of user interfaces and the whole creative aspect of designing them, but I've also really loved bringing those sketches to life on the technical side.  
One of my goals this quarter is to dig into what I want my career out of college to look like, and to be really intentional with my software development practice.
Part of this involves reflecting on WHY I'm choosing the tools that I use for a project, and keeping sustainability in mind - all things that CSE 110 seems to be exposing us to, so I'm pretty hyped about this class! I'm especially excited about how it's prompting us to critically think about our field, and actively WANT to be better developers and people.  

## Interests
Outside of work and academics, I'm an relatively outdoorsy person who loves to run, hike, and be active, whether that's through hitting the gym or doing yoga. I also love to cook, read, write, and sing.

I'm always happy to meet new people. Here's to an amazing Spring!

## Fun Corner
### Principles of Life
- enjoy the small things
- reflect on what makes you grateful
- you are a plant: give yourself water and sun
- results happen overtime, not overnight
- think about WHY as well as how
### My favorite breakfast recipe
#### [Multigrain Porridge]((/imgs/eight-treasure-Congee.jpg))
**Ingredients:**  

1. Purple rice
2. Quinoa
3. Sticky millet
4. Mung beans or adzuki beans or both
5. White rice or oats or whatever other grain you want to use in your pantry
6. Black sesame powder  

**Steps:**  

1. Wash all the grains; to save containers you can put the rice and beans together, and the millet and quinoa together
2. Soak them overnight
3. Throw everything in an instant pot or normal pot, add triple the amount of dry ingredients of your choice of milk
4. If using instant pot, cook for 22 minutes on porridge setting; in normal pot, simmer on medium low for an hour, stirring periodically
5. Serve with honey to taste, and peanut butter!
