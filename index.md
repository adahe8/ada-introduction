## Hi, my name is Ada!

I'm a 3rd year majoring in Cognitive Science (Machine Learning & Neural Compuation track), and working towards a computer science minor.  
I've done work in web accessibility, user-centric design, and frontend development! Like a ton of new developers today, 
I started out using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but transitioned into TypeScript and frameworks (mostly React) fairly early on. 
I really enjoy considering the accessibility of user interfaces and the whole creative aspect of designing them, but I've also really loved bringing those sketches to life on the technical side.  
One of my goals this quarter is to dig into what I want my career out of college to look like, and to be really intentional with my software development practice.
Part of this involves reflecting on WHY I'm choosing the tools that I use for a project, and keeping sustainability in mind - all things that CSE 110 seems to be exposing us to,
so I'm pretty hyped about this class! I'm especially excited about how it's prompting us to critically think about our field, and actively WANT to be better developers and people.  
Outside of work and academics, I'm an relatively outdoorsy person who loves to run, hike, and be active, whether that's through hitting the gym or doing yoga. I also love to cook, read, write, and sing.
Here's to an amazing Spring!
